#Talk @ the Paris Machine Learning Meetup on the 3rd of March 2016

This talk is on video on [youtube here](https://youtu.be/TzRYF1lPP84?t=8m15s) (in french). It gives a general
quick outline of Mariana and shows how you can quickly make a neural network with one hidden layer and train it on mnist using Mariana.

To run the example you will need an internet connection to download the mnist dataset.
