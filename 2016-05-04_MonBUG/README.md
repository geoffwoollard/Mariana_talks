#Talk @ MonBUG (Montreal Bioinformatics User Group), 4th of May 2016

This talk give a quick outline of Mariana and shows how you can quickly make a neural network with forks and train it on mnist using Mariana.

The dataset for the overfitting example **dna_mlp_very_empty_filled.py** (Ydna.pkl) is generated by **makeDataset.py**. This script creates a dataset composed of DNA sequences extracted from the human Y chromosome and random DNA sequence. If you want to regenerate this dataset using **makeDataset.py** you will need to install pyGeno and import the human Y chromosome. You can find how to do that on [pyGeno's documentation](https://github.com/tariqdaouda/pyGeno)
